<h1>eleventy-starter</h1>
<p>A simple template for myself to get familiar with the folder structure for eleventy. The site is extremely barebones, with no JavaScript, just a couple lines of CSS/styling, no pagination or tags. If you're looking for a fool-proof solution for a text-heavy blog site, you're in the right place. View the live demo <a href="eleventy-barebones-starter.netlify.app/">here</a>.</p>

<p>In case the GitHub ecosystem is unfamiliar to you, please check out the official <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/">starter guide</a>!</p>
<h1>Getting started:</h1>
<p>Run the following commands in your local terminal:</p>
<pre><code>cd my-workspace

git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/partheus/eleventy-starter.git my-eleventy-blog

cd my-eleventy-blog

npm install
</code></pre>
<p>The project is now ready to go live! Run the following command to bring up a local environment with hot reload (any changes you make in the local text editor will reflect immediately in the browser window):</p>
<pre><code>npm run dev
</code></pre>
<p>Open http://localhost:8080 in a browser of your choice. If everything was done right, you should see the homepage of the starter blog! Screenshot attached below. You're now ready to start customizing the site according to your needs! For further help, check out the official 11ty docs here: https://www.11ty.dev/docs/</p>
