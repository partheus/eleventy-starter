# eleventy-starter
A simple template for myself to get familiar with the folder structure for eleventy. The site is extremely barebones, no js, a couple lines of css, no pagination.

# Getting started:
Run the following commands in your local terminal:

  cd my-workspace
  git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/partheus/eleventy-starter.git my-eleventy-blog
  cd my-eleventy-blog
  npm install
